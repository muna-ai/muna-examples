# Muna has enhanced support for enumeration arguments. During codegen, the compiler 
# will extract the enumeration members into the predictor signature.
# On `https://muna.ai`, this is how we show dropdowns for enumeration parameters.
# NOTE: The enumeration member values **MUST** be all be strings or integers (no mixing either!).
