from muna import compile

# The Muna compiler imposes restrictions on the entrypoint function (i.e. function decorated with `@compile`).
# One such restriction is that the function **must not** return a union/variant type.
# But this restriction is a bit fake. The compiler does in fact support variant types.
# We just don't like it because it messes with signature inference.

# TL;DR: You can't annotate the entrypoint to return a union, but you can return a union ğŸ˜‡
