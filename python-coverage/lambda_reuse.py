# Muna currently has partial support for lambda expressions.
# We can trace through lambdas, and even lower calls to lambdas. The challenge is in treating them as objects.
# In Python, you can pass around a lambda, add it to a list, add arbitrary attributes, and so on.
# In native code, we can only make a lambda concrete by attaching types to it.
# Hence for now we support invoking lambdas, but not treating them as plain objects.
