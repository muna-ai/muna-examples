# Image Classification Predictors
This folder contains a few predictors that classify images using popular image classification models.

## Running a Classification Sample
The first step is to run the prediction function directly. First, we recommend installing [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) as it simplifies working with Python dependencies. Once `uv` is installed, you can run 
any of the image classification predictors by simply executing the script directly:
```bash
# Run this in Terminal
$ uv run image-classification/resnet_50.py
```

`uv` will automatically install any required Python packages then run the script.

## Compiling the Predictor
Once you have chosen an image classification predictor to use in your application, first update the predictor tag of the 
classification function with your Muna username:
```diff
# Define predictor
@compile(
-   tag="@pytorch/resnet-50",
+   tag="@<YOUR MUNA USERNAME>/resnet-50",
    ...
)
def classify(...) -> tuple[str, float]:
    ...
```

Next, compile the Python code with Muna:
```bash
# Run this in Terminal
$ muna compile --overwrite image-classification/resnet_50.py
```

Muna will generate and compile self-contained native code (C++, Rust, etc) that runs the image classification model.

## Running the Predictor
Once compiled, you can run the predictor on any device using our client libraries. For example, run the predictor in 
the command line:
```bash
# Run this in Terminal
$ muna predict @USERNAME/resnet-50 --image @path/to/image.jpg
```

> [!TIP]
> Muna compiles predictors to run on Android, iOS, macOS, Linux, visionOS, WebAssembly, and Windows. We provide
> client libraries to run these predictors for JavaScript, Kotlin, Android, React Native, Unity, and more.
